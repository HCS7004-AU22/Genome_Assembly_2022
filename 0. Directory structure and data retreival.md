## Configuring your basic directory structure

Basic directory structure
in
```
cd /fs/ess/scratch/PAS2303/Jonathan
mkdir Assembly
cd Assembly
mkdir Raw_Data Illumina Nanopore Software Joint_Assembly Polishing
mkdir Illumina/QC Illumina/Preprocessing Illumina/Assessment Illumina/kmer_analysis
mkdir Nanopore/kmer_analysis
mkdir Polishing/Alignments Polishing/Alignments/Illumina Polishing/Alignments/Nanopore
```

Getting data
```
cd Raw_Data
cp -r /fs/ess/PAS2303/HCS7004_Files/Genome_Assembly/*fastq.gz .
cp /fs/ess/PAS2303/HCS7004_Files/Genome_Assembly/raw_data_md5sum.md5 .
```

What did we get in there?
```
ls
```

Checking data integrity
```
md5sum -c raw_data_md5sum.md5
```
You are done here, so let's move a directory up
```
cd ..
```

**FYI**: If you want to make this to your own files, you have to do this in your original folder:
```
find -type f -exec md5sum '{}' \; > md5sum.md5
```
This will create the md5sum file of your data that can be checked in another computer when the data is transferred
